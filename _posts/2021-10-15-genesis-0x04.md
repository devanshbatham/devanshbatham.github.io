Can you master Solidity in 30 days? No, you cannot.

Can you learn about the basics and get started with development of real world projects using Solidity in 30 days? Yes, you sure can.

We all have different level of experience and familiarity with different programming languages. Now that you are here, I am assuming that you are already familier with basic Javascript syntax and Object Oriented paradigm. If you are not, I would suggest you to learn JavaScript before starting with Solidity. You don't need to learn each and everything about JavaScript.All you need for getting started is some basic understanding of JS syntax and object oriented programming.
