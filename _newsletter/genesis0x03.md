#  👋 Howdy
I hope you all are doing well and fine! Welcome to the awesome world of Blockchain Security. I am back with the third edition of our **Genesis Series** i.e. [Genesis 0x03](https://devansh.xyz/blockchain-security/2021/10/01/genesis-0x03.html)


# 🤔 What is Ethereum? 
Seeing the potential of blockchain and its applications, people started proposing various use-cases of blockchain for solving a wide range of problems. Creating separate blockchains from scratch for different tasks was time-consuming and not scalable at all, as a result, Ethereum was created, which enabled developers to build and publish smart contracts (self-executing/autonomous blocks of code) and distributed applications that can be used without the risks of downtime, fraud, or interference from a third party.

Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by a Canadian-Russian programmer Vitalik Buterin. Its Development started in 2014, and the network went live on 30 July 2015.


# Ethereum 2.0
“Change is the only constant element in this universe", same also applies to Ethereum. Ethereum 2.0, also known as Eth2 or Serenity is an upgrade to the Ethereum blockchain. The upgrade aims to enhance the speed, efficiency, and scalability of the Ethereum network so that it can process more transactions and ease bottlenecks.



# ⏩ Fast track learning
- Blockchain is a peer-to-peer, distributed computer network, which makes use of cryptography to securely host applications, store data, and transfer instruments of value. 

- Anyone can add new transactions to the blockchain, but the previous transactions cannot be tampered with without everyone noticing.

- Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible.

- Bitcoin is based on a global, peer-to-peer value transfer and transaction protocol (i.e., the blockchain).

- Bitcoin works on consensus protocol (majority wins).

- Bitcoin transactions can take as little as 15 minutes and as much as over an hour depending on network congestion.

- The larger the Bitcoin network grows the more secure it gets.

- Proof of work is more costly than Proof of stake.
