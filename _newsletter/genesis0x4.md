#  👋 Howdy
I hope you all are doing well and fine! Welcome to the awesome world of Blockchain Security. I am back with the forth edition of our **Genesis Series** i.e. [Genesis 0x04](https://devansh.xyz/blockchain-security/2021/10/16/genesis-0x04.html)


# 💡 Learning Solidity
Can you master Solidity in 30 days? **No, you cannot.**

Can you learn about the basics and get started with the development of real-world projects using Solidity in 30 days?  **Yes, you sure can**.

# 🏷️ [Day 1 - Day 5] JavaScript: The Starting Block

We all have different levels of experience and familiarity with programming languages. Now that you are here, I assume you are already familiar with basic JavaScript syntax and the Object-Oriented paradigm. If you are not, I would suggest you should learn JavaScript before starting with Solidity. You don't need to learn A-Z of JavaScript. All you need for getting started is a basic understanding of JS syntax and object-oriented programming.

# 🏷️ [Day 6] Frameworks
Even though we are not going to use any of these frameworks as of now, but we need to know what different frameworks are available to build dapps.

# 🏷️ [Day 7 - Day 10] Understanding Solidity
Solidity is an object-oriented/contract-oriented, high-level language for writing smart contracts. It is statically typed, supports inheritance, and is highly influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript.


# 🏷️[Day 12 - Day 17] On-hands Practice
We are familiar with Solidity documentation now. It is time to write actual code, let's practice Solidity by understanding and re-writing the some example contracts.

# 🏷️ [Day 18 - Day 19] Micro-projects
From Day 12 to Day 17, we completed code practice of various Solidity concepts, now it is time to put all of those learnings from previous days into micro-projects.

# 🏷️ [Day 21 - Day 25] Secrurity Considerations
We are now familiar with foundations concepts of Solidity programming, it is right time for us to understand what common vulnerabilities can be present in smart contracts and how you can spot and mitigate them. 

# 🏷️ [Day 26 - Day 27] Tools and Frameworks
During these two days, our goal is to get familiar with existing tools and frameworks which can be useful while performing security audits related to smart contracts. Please note that there is no need to know A-Z about these tools, for now, just play around with them, get familiar, and test them out, and most importantly, Have fun!

# 🏷️ [Day 28 - Day 29] Reading audit reports
During these 2 days, we will be going through publicly available smart contracts audit reports, and see what kind of real-world vulnerabilities are generally present in Solidity code. I believe there is no need for me to include a list of URLs that host public audit reports, as they are just a Google search away.

# 💪 30 Days Challenge
If you do start this 30 days challenge, you can post your progress on Twitter with hashtag #30DaysOfSolidity and don't forget to tag me [@0xAsm0d3us](https://twitter.com/0xAsm0d3us). I'll be happy to see your progress. For any query, you can reach out to me via Twitter, I'll be glad to help. All the best ❤️
