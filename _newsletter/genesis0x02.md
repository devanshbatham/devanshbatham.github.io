#  👋 Howdy
I hope you all are doing well and fine! Welcome to the awesome world of Blockchain Security. I am back with the second edition of our **Genesis Series** i.e. [Genesis 0x02](https://devansh.xyz/blockchain-security/2021/09/23/genesis-0x02.html)


# 🤔 What is a Blockchain? 
Blockchains are trending, we hear about them almost everyday. Whenever we search about them on the internet we are blown away with **buzz** words like decentralized, distributed, time-stamped, etc. but do we really understand them? I am pretty sure that by the end of [this article](https://devansh.xyz/blockchain-security/2021/09/23/genesis-0x02.html) you will have a pretty decent understanding of Blockchains and how do they work.

# 📗 Explain like I'm five
A blockchain is like a digital ledger used to hold transactions, transactions that transfer or hold instruments of value (that represent real money). Anyone can add a new transaction to a blockchain, however, the previous transactions cannot be tampered with without everyone noticing. 

# ⏩ Fast track learning
- Blockchain is a peer-to-peer, distributed computer network, which makes use of cryptography to securely host applications, store data, and transfer instruments of value. 

- Anyone can add new transactions to the blockchain, but the previous transactions cannot be tampered with without everyone noticing.

- Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible.

- Bitcoin is based on a global, peer-to-peer value transfer and transaction protocol (i.e., the blockchain).

- Bitcoin works on consensus protocol (majority wins).

- Bitcoin transactions can take as little as 15 minutes and as much as over an hour depending on network congestion.

- The larger the Bitcoin network grows the more secure it gets.

- Proof of work is more costly than Proof of stake.
