Can you master Solidity in 30 days? **No, you cannot.**

Can you learn about the basics and get started with the development of real-world projects using Solidity in 30 days?  **Yes, you sure can**, and this article aims to provide you with a roadmap following which you can learn Solidity in a much more efficient way.


# Learning Hacks

> "I realized that becoming a master of karate was not about learning 4,000 moves but about doing just a handful of moves 4,000 times."
— Chet Holmes

Before we proceed further, let's talk about some hacks that I use for learning any skill or programming language in a faster manner.

- Before going to bed, recite what you learned for 5 mins.

- Don't push yourself beyond your capacity, always keep in mind that excellence can only be attained when it is organic.

- Teach someone else (or just pretend to) what you learned.

- Get proper sleep, research shows that sleeping between two learning sessions greatly improves retention.

- Take notes by hand (Yes, I agree that this might sound anti-digital, but believe me, it improves our knowledge retention).


- Stay hydrated and exercise regularly. A healthy mind breeds a healthy body, and vice versa!



# [Day 1 - Day 5] Javascript: The Starting Block

We all have different levels of experience and familiarity with programming languages. Now that you are here, I assume you are already familiar with basic Javascript syntax and the Object-Oriented paradigm. If you are not, I would suggest you learn JavaScript before starting with Solidity. You don't need to learn A-Z of JavaScript. All you need for getting started is a basic understanding of JS syntax and object-oriented programming.

# Day 
We learned javascript and now we have a fairly decent understanding of object orianted programming as well. What next? Can we start learning solidity now? Yes, we can. 

During your staring days, I would suggest you to use [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for writing and compiling solidity code. As we get more familiar, we will start using a more robust smart contract development framework (such as Truffle, Dapptools, etc).
