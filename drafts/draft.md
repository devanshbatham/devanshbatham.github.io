Can you master Solidity in 30 days? **No, you cannot.**

Can you learn about the basics and get started with the development of real-world projects using Solidity in 30 days?  **Yes, you sure can**, and this article aims to provide you with a roadmap following which you can learn Solidity in a much more efficient way.


# 💡 Learning Hacks

> "I realized that becoming a master of karate was not about learning 4,000 moves but about doing just a handful of moves 4,000 times."
— Chet Holmes

Before we proceed further, let's talk about some hacks that I use for learning any skill or programming language in a faster manner.

- Before going to bed, recite what you learned for 5 mins.

- Don't push yourself beyond your capacity, always keep in mind that excellence can only be attained when it is organic.

- Teach someone else (or just pretend to) what you learned.

- Get proper sleep, research shows that sleeping between two learning sessions greatly improves retention.

- Take notes by hand (Yes, I agree that this might sound anti-digital, but believe me, it improves our knowledge retention).


- Stay hydrated and exercise regularly. A healthy mind breeds a healthy body, and vice versa!



# 🏷️ [Day 1 - Day 5] Javascript: The Starting Block

We all have different levels of experience and familiarity with programming languages. Now that you are here, I assume you are already familiar with basic Javascript syntax and the Object-Oriented paradigm. If you are not, I would suggest you should learn JavaScript before starting with Solidity. You don't need to learn A-Z of JavaScript. All you need for getting started is a basic understanding of JS syntax and object-oriented programming.

# 🏷️ [Day 6] Frameworks
We learned javascript and now we have a fairly decent understanding of object-oriented programming as well. What next? Can we start learning solidity now? Yes, we can. 

As we are just getting started with Solidity, I would suggest you use [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for writing and compiling solidity code for now. As we gain more experience and familiarity with Solidity, we will start using a more robust Dapp development framework (such as Truffle, Hardhat, Dapptools, etc) because building a full-fledged decentralized application requires different pieces of technologies, and software frameworks include many of those needed features.

Even though we are not going to use any of these frameworks as of now, but we need to know what different frameworks are available to build dapps.
