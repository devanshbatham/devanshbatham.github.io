# `Blockchain`
We keep hearing about blockchains all the time, and whenever we search about them on the internet we are blown away with **buzz** words like decentralized, distributed, time-stamped, etc. but do we really understand them? Let's do a quick exercise, I want you to search **What is Blockchain?** on Google, then after a minute or two, try to explain the definition that you learned from the Google search results to yourself.

If you were able to successfully complete this exercise, congratulations 🎉. But If you still don't understand, that's totally fine as well, by the end of this article you will have a pretty decent idea of what a blockchain is.

# `Explain like I'm five`

A blockchain is like a digital ledger used to hold transactions, transactions that transfer instruments of value (that represent real money). Anyone can add a new transaction to a blockchain, however, the previous transactions cannot be tampered with without everyone noticing. 

Blockchains do not need any central authority for their functioning, as a result, they do not have any single point of failure. 

#### `Some common words that we will be using throughout this series:`

- **P2P:** Every computer or node can act as a server for the others, allowing shared access to resources without the need for a central server.

- **Decentralized and Distributed:** In a decentralized blockchain network, no one has to know or trust anyone else. Each member in the network has a copy of the exact same data in the form of a distributed ledger.

- **Timestamp:** It is a small data stored in each block as a unique serial number which can be used as the **proof for notarization**.

- **Hash Functions:** Hash functions are the backbone of any blockchain, The same data will always produce the same hashed value. Bitcoin's blockchain uses **SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm)** hashing algorithm

- **Immutable** - The use of cryptographic functions makes a Blockchain immutable. Cryptographic functions return a hash value, which cannot be reverse-engineered, as a result, transactions cannot be tampered with without everyone noticing. 

# `But why do we need a blockchain?`

Blockchain solve various problems; one of them is **double-spending** problem. 


Let's imagine you have a candy store, and someone walks into your store with only **$1** in hand, one candy costs **$1**. He buys one candy with that **$1**, and then he buys another candy with the same **$1**, he used **$1** to buy 2 candies. This is the classic **double-spending** problem, while this appears to be physically impossible as the store owner can easily verify the fraudulent transactions in real-time, but with digital currency, it is very much possible.

That's where blockchain can be used to solve this problem, As stated previously, a blockchain uses a distributed ledger to publically record all transactions on the network, which allows anyone to view the entire history of each coin, and prove that no coin was spent twice.

# `History of Blockchain`
We know blockchain because of bitcoin, yes it is true that blockchain got popular after the release of bitcoin, however the concept of blockchain was coined way before that.

Let's go through [the brief history of blockchain](https://www.icaew.com/technical/technology/blockchain/blockchain-articles/what-is-blockchain/history) and it how evolved over time: 

- **1991** - The term blockchain was first introduced by **Stuart Haber** and **W Scott Stornetta** for describing a cryptographically secured chain of blocks.

- **1998** - Computer scientist **Nick Szabo** introduced **Bit Gold**.


- **2000** - **Stefan** Konst publishes his theory of cryptographic secured chains, along with ideas of implementation.

- **2008** - Developer or group of developers working under the pseudonym **Satoshi Nakamoto** released a white paper establishing the model for a blockchain.

- **2009** - **Bitcoin** was born.

- **2013-2015 - Blockchain 2.0:** Ethereum came into existence.

- **2016** - **Ethereum Classic** was born out of a contentious 2016 debate after a malicious hacker stole $60 million worth of ether.


- **2017** - A new blockchain protocol **EOS.IO** by **block.one** was created for the deployment of decentralized applications.


That was all from my side in this article; See you very soon in `Genesis 0x03`, Keep warm, stay hydrated and have good day ahead :)
