# Ethereum's Creation
We learned about blockchains in [our previous article](https://devansh.xyz/blockchain-security/2021/09/23/genesis-0x02.html). We also discussed a little about Bitcoin and how it solves the double-spending problem by maintaining a distributed ledger to publicly record all transactions on the network, which allows anyone to view the entire history of each coin, and prove that no coin was spent twice. So far, so good.

Bitcoin was created solely for storing/sending/receiving digital money in a safe, secure, and decentralized manner without the involvement of any governing body, which started the new era, called **Cryptoeconomics**, however seeing the potential of blockchain and its applications, people started proposing various use-cases of blockchain for solving a wide range of problems. Creating separate blockchains from scratch for different tasks was time-consuming and not scalable at all, as a result, **Ethereum** was created, which enabled developers to build and publish smart contracts (self-executing/autonomous blocks of code) and distributed applications that can be used without the risks of downtime, fraud, or interference from a third party.


[Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) was conceived in 2013 by a Canadian-Russian programmer
 **Vitalik Buterin**. Its Development started in **2014**, and the network went live on **30 July 2015**.


**Vitalik** wrote a [detailed article](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html) in 2017 titles **A Prehistory of the Ethereum Protocol**, following are few excerpts from [that article](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/09/14/prehistory.html).

> This was the time when the Ethereum protocol was entirely my own creation. From here on, however, new participants started to join the fold. By far the most prominent on the protocol side was Gavin Wood, who reached out to me in an about.me message in December 2013.

> Gavin can also be largely credited for the subtle change in vision from viewing Ethereum as a platform for building programmable money, with blockchain-based contracts that can hold digital assets and transfer them according to pre-set rules, to a general-purpose computing platform. This started with subtle changes in emphasis and terminology, and later this influence became stronger with the increasing emphasis on the “Web 3” ensemble, which saw Ethereum as being one piece of a suite of decentralized technologies, the other two being Whisper and Swarm.

> By the summer of 2014, the protocol had considerably stabilized, with the major exception of the proof of work algorithm which would not reach the Ethash phase until around the beginning of 2015, and a semi-formal specification existed in the form of Gavin's yellow paper.

**Q- What do I mean by the term Ethereum?** 

Well... it can be used to refer to three distinct things:

- The Ethereum protocol.
- The Ethereum network.
- The Ethereum project.  

**Q- Is Ethereum and Ether the same thing?**

**Ethereum** is a decentralized, open-source, programmable blockchain which enables developers to build and publish smart contracts (self-executing/autonomous blocks of code) and distributed applications that can be used without the risks of downtime, fraud, or interference from a third party. **Ether (ETH or Ξ)** is the native cryptocurrency of the platform.

**Q- How Ethereum is different from Bitcoin?**

Bitcoin was too limited in its functionality. In an interview with [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/vitalik-buterin-created-ethereum-one-of-the-worlds-three-largest-cryptocurrencies-2019-1?r=US&amp;IR=T), he compared it to a pocket calculator that **does one thing well**, whereas he said Ethereum is more like a smartphone with multiple applications you can use.

**Q- Is Ethereum Better Than Bitcoin?**

Can you compare a mango with a banana? **No**. In other words, Ethereum has much wider ambitions. It wants to be a decentralized computing platform for creating other decentralized applications, while Bitcoin is digital gold. 




That was all from my side in this article; See you very soon in **Genesis 0x04**, Keep warm, stay hydrated and have good day ahead :)
