# Ethereum's Creation
We learned about blockchains in our previous article. We also discussed a little about Bitcoin and how it solves the double-spending problem by maintaining a distributed ledger to publicly record all transactions on the network, which allows anyone to view the entire history of each coin, and prove that no coin was spent twice. So far, so good.

Bitcoin was created solely for storing/sending/receiving digital money in a safe, secure, and decentralized manner without the involvement of any governing body, which started the new era, called **Cryptoeconomics**, however seeing the potential of blockchain and its applications, people started proposing various use-cases of blockchain for solving a wide range of problems. Creating separate blockchains from scratch for different tasks was time-consuming and not scalable at all, as a result, **Ethereum** was created, which enabled developers to build and publish smart contracts (self-executing/autonomous blocks of code) and distributed applications that can be used without the risks of downtime, fraud, or interference from a third party.


[Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) was conceived in 2013 by a Canadian-Russian programmer
 **Vitalik Buterin**. Its Development started in **2014**, and the network went live on **30 July 2015**.

# FaQs
Q- What do I mean by the term **Ethereum**? Well... it can be used to refer to three distinct things:

- The Ethereum protocol.
- The Ethereum network.
- The Ethereum project.  

Q- Is **Ethereum** and **Ether** the same thing?

**Ethereum** is a decentralized, open-source, programmable blockchain which enables developers to build and publish smart contracts (self-executing/autonomous blocks of code) and distributed applications that can be used without the risks of downtime, fraud, or interference from a third party. **Ether (ETH or Ξ)** is the native cryptocurrency of the platform.

Q- How **Ethereum** is different from **Bitcoin**?

Bitcoin was too limited in its functionality. In an interview with [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/vitalik-buterin-created-ethereum-one-of-the-worlds-three-largest-cryptocurrencies-2019-1?r=US&amp;IR=T), he compared it to a pocket calculator that **does one thing well**, whereas he said Ethereum is more like a smartphone with multiple applications you can use.


That was all from my side in this article; See you very soon in `Genesis 0x04`, Keep warm, stay hydrated and have good day ahead :)
